main:



void myFunction() {

}



int myVariable = 1;



goto main;



{
// new scope (also this is comment) 
}



use "filename.wtii"  // Includes file scope into current file



class myType {
    int myVariable = 1;
    void myFunction() {
        int myVariable = 2;
        myVariable = 3;
    }
}



Entry point is:
main:
or
int main()
or
void main()
or start of file

in that priority order
